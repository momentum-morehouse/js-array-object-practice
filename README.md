# Directions

- Your homework tonight is to complete the exercises on this [site](https://github.com/momentum-morehouse/js-array-object-practice.git).
- Note that there are links to Repls for practice throughout the assignment. Replit will make a personal copy for you (called a fork)
as soon as you start typing. _You do not need to create a Repl for this assignment_.
- Instead of pasting on the page, as the directions say, please paste the links to your Repls in this README.
