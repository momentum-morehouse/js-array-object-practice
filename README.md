# Directions

- Your homework tonight is to complete the exercises on this [site](https://github.com/momentum-morehouse/js-array-object-practice.git).
- Make a new JavScript Repl.
as soon as you start typing. _You do not need to create a Repl for this assignment_.
- Instead of pasting on the page, as the directions say, please paste the links to your Repls in this README.
